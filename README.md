# CharSketchKgp
 This would be designed as a web application where a user writes a character sketch about somebody else. A single link would be generated for each character sketch which could be accessed privately or publicly. In the case of public sketches, the person receiving the sketch has the freedom to remove the sketch if that appears offending in any case. For private sketches, the receiver needs his password to access it.
